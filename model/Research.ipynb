As in other Question Answering tasks, the model is presented with a question, and is required to generate a natural language answer. Whereas a majority of QA datasets contain mostly factoid questions, where the answer, such as a date or the name of a single entity, can be expressed in a few words or single sentence, Long Form QA focuses on questions which call for an explanation consisting of a few sentences or a few paragraphs.\n",

Note that the nlp.load_dataset command above actually downloaded questions and their associated answers from the r/explainlikeimfive, r/askscience, and r/AskHistorians subreddits. We focus here on the ELI5/explainlikeimfive part to train the system, as these examples tend to be a little simpler."

Models such as [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) or [REALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909) for example learn to compute a vector representation of the query, as well as vector representations of Wikipedia passages in such a way that the passages that best answers a question maximize the dot product between the two representations. Retrieval is then reduced to a Maximum Inner Product Search, which can be executed efficiently using systems like [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).\n",

On the one hand, the [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) system is trained using gold passage annotations: most major QA dataset tell the system which Wikipedia passage contains the answer. Unfortunately, we do not have such annotations for the ELI5 data. On the other hand, while [REALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909) is trained without passage supervision, it requires a pretty expensive pre-training step with an [Inverse Cloze Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00300) (100,000 steps with batch size 4096), and the ability to re-compute the embeddings of all Wikipedia passages regularly during training.\n",

    "In order to train a similar dense retrieval system at reduced cost without having access to gold passage annotation, we will have to **take advantage of another unique feature of our dataset**, namely the fact that the long form answers are quite similar in style to the Wikipedia passages we want to index. Our hypothesis then is that if we train a system to embed the questions and answers in our dataset in a way that allows us to easily match questions to answers, then using the answer embedder on Wikipedia passages should allow us to similarly match questions to supporting evidence from Wikipedia.\n",

Conduction On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact. Fluidsâ€”especially gasesâ€”are less conductive. Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. The process of heat transfer</td>\n",

Among other applications, they show that large-scale pre-training with their objective followed by fine-tuning on ELI5 data yields the state-of-the-art ROUGE performance for the original version of the dataset (which uses pre-computed support documents made from CommonCrawl pages).\n",
